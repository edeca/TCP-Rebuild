TCP-Rebuild
===========

A Perl alternative to utilities such as tcpick or tcpflow, with the 
benefit of extra options, bugfixes and it should work on 64-bit machines.

Uses Net::LibNIDS to do the hard work, which requires the C libnids
library.

Many thanks to CPAN::Mini, which I learnt much from whilst packaging this
module.
